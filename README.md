‘APCalign-app’ is a Shiny interface to the [‘APCalign’ R
package](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/). The app enables users
to standardise their plant taxa names to current, accepted standards by
the [Australian Plant Census (APC)](Australian%20Plant%20Census%20(APC))

To run the app:

``` r
shiny::runApp()
```
